wagtail-readinglevel
====================

A lightweight Wagtail plugin to determine the reading level of text input into a rich text field.

Currently there are two available modes:
1. (Default) Reading Age - calculated using the [Automated Readability Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index)
2. SMOG Index - calculates the [SMOG Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG) (only suitable for English).

!! This is an experimental build meant to test yet unreleased api features in Wagtail. It uses a monkeypatch to work specifically with Wagtail 2.0 and will likely break in a future release of Wagtail. !!
