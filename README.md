# wagtail-readinglevel
A lightweight Wagtail plugin to determine the reading level of text input into a rich text field.

Currently there are two available modes:
1. (Default) Reading Age - calculated using the [Automated Readability Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_readability_index).
2. SMOG Index - calculated the [SMOG Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG) (only suitable for English).
3. Coleman-Liau Index - calculated using the [Coleman-Liau Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleman%E2%80%93Liau_index).
4. Flesch Score - calculated using the [Flesch Reading Ease forumal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests) (only suitable for English).

!! This is an experimental build meant to test yet unreleased api features in Wagtail. It uses a monkeypatch to work specifically with Wagtail 2.0 and will likely break in a future release of Wagtail. !!

## Installation
